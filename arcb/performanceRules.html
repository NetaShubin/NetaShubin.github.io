                <p><span>Providing numerous performance opportunities is a crucial component to the overall dance education </span>for students at the Academy of Russian Classical Ballet. Typically, ARCB students will participate in a Winter Performance
                    of The Nutcracker in December and a Spring Performance at the end of the second semester.</p>
                <p>Performances offer a chance for students to participate in a cumulative experience of their training in the academy, and to learn firsthand the artistry, expression, and technical excellence expected of accomplished artists. Students also
                    learn how to conduct themselves professionally backstage while working with a professional stage crew, and gain valuable lessons in teamwork, adaptability, and compliance. Students ARCB will have the unique opportunity to perform works
                    in the classical ballet repertoire, as well as original choreography by ARCB artistic staff.</p>

                <p><span>Participation</span> in these performances is optional, but it’s expected of each student, as performing experience is an essential element of effective dance training. All students enrolled in ballet classes are eligible to participate
                    in ARCB performances*. Only students of level B and above can participate in The Nutcracker. Students of Level A* may be invited to Nutcracker only if they participated in previous ARCB performances and after approval by the Artistic
                    Director.

                <p><span>A performance fee is applied. </span>The performance fee does not include in your semester tuition payment and will be charged separately. Performance fees are non-refundable and non-transferable from one student to another.</p>
                <p>All costumes are provided by ARCB (except cases if used some special costumes, ex.: costumes for contemporary dances, solo variations, etc.) and remain the property of the ballet academy after performances. ARCB does not charge any additional
                    fee for renting costumes.</p>

                <p>The <span>casting of roles in productions may be accomplished by assignment or audition</span>, depending on the specific requirements of each production. Please note that casting is made at the sole and entire discretion of the Artistic
                    Faculty, and is non-negotiable. There are many factors that affect casting decisions including but not limited to, costume sizes, numbers needed, student’s technical and artistic proficiency, and the Artistic Director’s vision for
                    a particular piece or role. In addition, all casting is tentative and subject to change, pending the student’s participation and/or progress in rehearsals. Students are encouraged to give their utmost to each role they receive and
                    work hard to be professional in their execution of each role.</p>

                    their role/ dance/ part; multiple absences are grounds for dismissal from the performance. In the case of student illness, please contact the Admissions Director to let us know if your child will be unable to attend a rehearsal.</p>
                <p><span>Understudies: </span>Students that are listed as “understudies” for a particular role are expected to attend all rehearsals for that role. Students are not guaranteed to perform the role for which they are understudying, however,
                    they should be proficient enough in the choreography to be able to step into the role in the case of student illness or injury or a similar emergency situation.</p>
                <p><span>Scheduling: </span>All rehearsals will be held at the academy on weekends. For Nutcracker and Spring Performance, students should attend rehearsals on Saturdays after 4 pm and Sunday after 11 am. Additional rehearsals may be scheduled
                    after regular classes at the discretion of the Artistic Director.</p>
