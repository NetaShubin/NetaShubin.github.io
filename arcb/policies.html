                <h1>Ettiquette:</h1>
                <p>The following rules are universal and are followed by all major ballet programs and professional companies. All students enrolled at ARCB, and their parents, should familiarize themselves with these rules of etiquette and observe them
                    at all times.</p>
            </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Students must arrive <span>on time</span> to the class. Students should arrive at least 10 minutes before class to prepare themselves appropriately.</li>
                    <li>Students do not wait for teachers before entering the studio and should be prepared to begin class as soon as the teacher enters.</li>
                    <li>All students must follow the <a href="dressCode.html" target="_self"><span>Academy’s Dress Code</span></a>. Ballet attire must be clean and in good repair for each class and performance.</li>
                    <li>Female students of all levels must have their hair pulled back in a ballet bun. A student without a proper ballet bun may not be permitted to join the class.</li>
                    <li>Students may not wear street shoes on the dance floors. Conversely, students are not to wear their ballet shoes outside the premises, as this brings small pebbles and other debris onto the Marley, which can severely damage the floor.</li>
                    <li>Be appreciative of corrections and apply them. <span>Students will progress only as fast as they can make corrections</span>.</li>
                    <li>Students may not talk among themselves while the instructor is speaking and giving instruction. If students have a question, they are to talk to the teacher after class.</li>
                    <li>If a parent(s) have a question to a teacher or wish to discuss a child’s progress, please schedule an appointment via email.</li>
                    <li>Leaning or hanging on the barre, yawning, and inattention are not acceptable forms of behavior during class.</li>
                    <li><span>Be kind to your classmates</span>. Displays of temper, rudeness, and gossip are unacceptable.</li>
                    <li>Out of respect for our dancers, teachers, and administrative staff, please keep voices and activity in the lobby down to a minimum. Parents who observe their child’s class in the main classroom – DO NOT TALK!</li>
                    <li>All cell phones must be turned off during the class!</li>
                    <li>Students are not permitted to chew gum on the premises!</li>
                    <li><span>No food and drink in classes!</span> All food and beverages must be kept in the designated areas.</li>
                    <li>Students are asked to leave all valuables and money at home. ARCB cannot be responsible for lost items. Students should label dance shoes and personal belongings to avoid mix-ups.</li>
                    <li>Smoking is not permitted anywhere on the premises or while representing ARCB in public.</li>
                    <li>No jewelry allowed in any ARCB classes or rehearsals, with the exception of small stud earrings.</li>

                <h1>Attendance Rules:</h1>
                <p>Due to the big demand for our classes we ask you to <span>please give us advanced notice if your child will not be attending classes for a long period of time</span>. Otherwise, your child may lose their spot in the class. All classes
                    are subject to minimum/maximum enrollment. If there is no longer space available in a class or a class has been canceled, you will be notified as soon as possible. Class sizes are limited to 12 for Level A-A* and 15 for Level B-G.
                    <span>All scheduled classes and instructors are subject to change</span>. Students who wish to withdraw from classes must give two weeks’ notice via email. All amounts due must be paid in full (including tuition fee, performance fee,
                    or any outstanding private lesson fees). <span>Tuition is non-refundable</span>, with the following exceptions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Students whose classes are canceled for insufficient enrollment will be given their choice of a pro-rated account credit or tuition refund.</li>

                <h1>Missed classes:</h1>
                <p><span>Please notify the office if you are unable to attend a class</span>. Students may take a make-up class by scheduling with the Artistic Director or office staff to attend another class at the same or lower level. You must sign up
                    for make-up classes via e-mail in advance to avoid overcrowding. Parents must send a 24-hour email notice if a student cannot attend a scheduled make-up class, otherwise, the office will not be able to re-schedule it. We cannot guarantee
                    make-up classes; we do our best to find a make-up that works. We cannot prorate or refund for missed classes or canceled classes due to weather-related closures (see below) as well as scheduled holidays and breaks (such as Thanksgiving
                    Vacation, Spring Break, Summer Break, etc). Make-up classes are non-transferable from one semester to the other or/ and to the summer program and must be completed within the session.</p>

                <h1>Emergency Closure:</h1>
                <p>Academy of Russian Classical Ballet will cancel classes according to the Lake Washington School District decisions for school closures due to weather, road conditions, and other emergencies. There are no make-up classes for weather-related
                    closures, nor are tuition refunds available for these canceled classes. You can check the status of LWSD schools at www.lwsd.org.</p>

                <p><span>Video security: </span>Academy of Russian Classical Ballet strives to maintain a safe and secure environment for its staff and customers. In pursuit of this objective, selected areas of the academy premises are equipped with video
                    cameras. The academy’s Video Security System is used only for the protection and safety of students, employees, property, and to assist law enforcement in the event of an emergency. The Video Security System is a closed network of
                    cameras utilized to capture images and transmit them for display on closed-circuit monitors. The system is not used for live monitoring unless there is a significant rule violation or security situation. Cameras are not installed in
                    areas of the academy where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as in restrooms and dressing rooms.</p>
                <p><span>Supervision: </span>Students who are 12 years old and younger must leave each class/rehearsal with a parent. Students who are 16 years old and older may, with a parent’s permission on the file, leave the academy by themselves between
                    classes. Students between the ages of 12-16 who wish to leave the academy between classes may leave in small groups (no less than 3 students) and must notify the parent(s) as well as the Administrative Director before exiting the building.
                    Parents may not give permission that is more liberal than outlined above. Parents of level A and A* students should not leave the premise during their child’s class time.</p>

                <p>Students must be picked up no later than 15 minutes after class/ rehearsal; ARCB does not provide child-care after classes/ rehearsals have finished, so please make every effort not to be late to pick up your child.</p>
                <p>Unless you have received advance permission from ARCB’s staff, no one is allowed to take photos or videos of dancers during class or rehearsal.</p>
                <h1>Personal Belongings:</h1>
                <p>Students should keep their personal belongings and dance bags in the dressing room. Due to the limited space of the academy hallways and waiting areas should be kept clear and as neat as possible. Though ARCB is not responsible for lost
                    or stolen items, there is a Lost & Found box located in the dressing room; if you find a clothing item, dance shoe, or other items that are not your own, please put these in the Lost & Found box.</p>

                <p>Parents and students are reminded to clean up after themselves and to pick up all food wrappers, band-aids, and other trash items as they see them. We must all work together to maintain a clean, professional atmosphere for teaching. Please
                    do NOT leave your trash for someone else to clean up. Also please tidy up toys and books after playing in the children’s play area.</p>
                <h1>Social Media Policy:</h1>
                <p>All students are expected to use social media (examples being, but not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Google+, Flickr, blogs, etc.) with respect for the privacy and well-being of others and <span>should not post
                    and/or distribute anything that is abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another individual</span>. No one is allowed to take photos or videos of students/ instructors during classes or rehearsals and published these in the social media
