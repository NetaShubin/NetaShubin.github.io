                <p>Our beginning classes, for students ages three through five, provide developmentally appropriate dance education for our young dancers. For students ages six and older, we offer formal instruction in the Vaganova Method as well as additional
                    contemporary and modern lessons. These levels are for the students who would like to improve beyond the fundamentals of ballet. Students will work on improving their flexibility and begin to learn the more complicated steps and patterns
                    of classical ballet.</p>
                <p>We are committed to providing our students with the highest quality of education, preserving the traditions of Vaganova through a systematic approach that is based on the culture and curriculum of the Vaganova Method. At our Academy, we
                    strive to provide a safe and nurturing environment where our students can learn and grow as ballet students and people.</p>
